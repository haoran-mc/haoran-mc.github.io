<p>
<b>Word constituents: ‘w’:</b><br>
</p>

<p>
Parts of words in human languages. These are typically used in variable and command names in programs. All upper- and lower-case letters, and the digits, are typically word constituents.<br>
</p>

<p>
<b>Symbol constituents: ‘_’:</b><br>
</p>

<p>
Extra characters used in variable and command names along with word constituents. Examples include the characters ‘$&amp;*+-_&lt;&gt;’ in Lisp mode, which may be part of a symbol name even though they are not part of English words. In standard C, the only non-word-constituent character that is valid in symbols is underscore &ldquo; _ &rdquo;.<br>
