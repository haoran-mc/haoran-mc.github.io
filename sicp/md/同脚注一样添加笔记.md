不需要重写样式，使用已有的 `footnote_link` 就可以了

```html
<a class="footnote_link" id="NOTE01" href="#NOTE01">
	we begin with simplified, incomplete models
</a>
```

```html
<div class="footnote">
	<div id="NOTE01" style="display: none;">
		<p>Despite the simplicity of the substitution idea, it turns
		out to be surprisingly complicated to give a rigorous mathematical definition
		of the substitution process.  The problem arises from the possibility of
		confusion between the names used for the formal parameters of a procedure and
		the (possibly identical) names used in the expressions to which the procedure
		may be applied.  Indeed, there is a long history of erroneous definitions of
		substitution in the literature of logic and programming semantics.
		See Stoy 1977 for a careful discussion of substitution.</p>
	</div>
</div>
